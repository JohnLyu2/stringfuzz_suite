**StringFuzz Suite** is a repository of SMT-LIB string and regex instance suites that generated using StringFuzz [1], a modular string and regex fuzzer. This repository consists of two categories: one with new instances generated by StringFuzz (_generated_: 4170 instances); and another with
transformed instances generated from a small suite of industrial benchmarks
(_transformed_: 10682 instances).
